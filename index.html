    <p>Large-scale natural language processing models have been developed and integrated into numerous applications, given the advantage of their remarkable performance. Nonetheless, the security concerns associated with these models prevent the widespread adoption of these black-box machine learning models. In this tutorial, we will dive into three emerging security issues in NLP research, i.e., backdoor attacks, private data leakage, and imitation attacks. These threats will be introduced in accordance with their threatening usage scenarios, attack methodologies, and defense technologies.</p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">INTRODUCTION</span></h5>
    <p>Large-scale natural language processing models have recently garnered substantial attention due to their exceptional performance. This promotes a significant proliferation in the development and deployment of black-box NLP APIs across a wide range of applications. Simultaneously, an expanding body of research has revealed profound security vulnerabilities associated with these black-box APIs, encompassing issues such as dysfunctional failures (Gu et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2023), concerns related to privacy and data leakage (Coavoux et al., 2018; Carlini et al., 2021), and infringements on intellectual property (Wallace et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). Those security challenges can lead to issues like data misuse, financial loss, reputation damage, legal disputes, and more. It is worth noting that these security vulnerabilities are not mere theoretical assumptions. Previous research has demonstrated that both commercial APIs and publicly available models can be easily compromised (Wallace et al., 2020; Carlini et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022). This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the lastest research concerning security challenges in NLP models.</p>

<!-- Session 1 -->
<div class="w3-container" id="s1">
  <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
 
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Session 1: Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks</span></h5>
    <center><p>Slides: <a href="https://github.com/emnlp2023-nlp-security/emnlp2023-nlp-security.github.io/blob/main/slides/emnlp23_tutorial_backdoor.pdf">[pdf]</a ></p ></center>
  	<p>Large-scale natural language processing models have been developed and integrated into numerous applications, given the advantage of their remarkable performance. Nonetheless, the security concerns associated with these mWe begin by discussing adversarial attacks in NLP tasks. Such attacks manipulate inputs to compromise the performance of a target model (Alzantot et al., 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). Specifically, by altering specific characters or words, one can mislead a text classifier into assigning an incorrect label. This research underscores the vulnerability of trained NLP models. A notable subset of these attacks is the backdoor attack, wherein the victim model is induced to associate misbehaviors with particular triggers (Dai et al., 2019). During inference, backdoored models behave normally on clean inputs, whereas misbehaviors can be triggered when the malicious patterns are present. Those misbehaviors range from fooling text classifiers (Dai et al., 2019; Kurita et al., 2020) to mistranslating neutral phrases into controversial ones (Xu et al., 2021).</p>

<!-- Session 2 -->

  <div class="w3-content" style="max-width:700px">
 
    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Session 2: Imitation Attacks and Defenses</span></h5>
    <center><p>Slides: <a href="https://github.com/emnlp2023-nlp-security/emnlp2023-nlp-security.github.io/blob/main/slides/emnlp23_tutorial_model_extraction.pdf">[pdf]</a ></p ></center>
  	<p>Another security challenge within our scope will be the imitation attack on NLP models. With the advancement of NLP models, particularly large pre-trained language models, companies have encapsulated exceptional models into commercial APIs, serving millions of endusers. In order to foster a profitable market, service providers commonly implement pay-as-you-use policies for those APIs. To circumvent service charges, a seminal work (Tramèr et al., 2016) proposed the imitation of the functionality of commercial APIs by relying on predictions from those APIs. Subsequent research has revealed vulnerabilities associated with imitation attacks that extend beyond the violation of intellectual property, e.g., one can employ the imitation model to craft transferable adversarial examples capable of deceiving the victim model as well (Wallace et al., 2020; He et al., 2021). Moreover, the interaction between the victim model and the imitator can lead to significant privacy breaches (He et al., 2022a). Furthermore, Xu et al. (2022) demonstrate that imitation models can outperform the imitated victim models, particularly in the context of domain adaptation and model ensemble.</p>

<!-- Session 3 -->

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Session 3: Privacy and Data Leakage</span></h5>
  	<p>The third security challenge in NLP models is the potential risk of disclosing data, particularly sensitive content, to untrustworthy parties. A recent widely recognized example is the capability of pre-trained language models, e.g., GPT-2, to generate sentences containing sensitive information when provided with carefully designed prompts (Carlini et al., 2021). Another concern revolves around the possibility that certain information from the training data being inferred through the model’s parameters or the gradient updates, such as membership inference and text recovery (Melis et al., 2019; Gupta et al., 2022). These types of attacks pose significant challenges to collaborative learning of language models (Yang et al., 2019).</p>
